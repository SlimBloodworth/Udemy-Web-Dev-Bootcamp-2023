## Overview

This project is associated with the Web Developer Bootcamp 2023 Certification Course through Udemy taught by Colt Steele.
There are 61 Sections to this course. I recently complete the Git and GitHub Bootcamp Certification Course and wanted to get the practice in, so I will be using the BASH terminal and pushing changes with git.
This is where I will keep the majority of the exercises for this course as well.
